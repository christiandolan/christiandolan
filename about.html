        <h1>How are you today?</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Christian Dolan and I am a sophmore at URI. I major right now in computer engineering but I also find interest in computer science as I took it in highschool. I am from Long Island, New York and I really enjoy being home. I am one of the first people from my family to truly go away for school. I have two younger siblings, one who just started her freshman year at SUNY PLattsburgh in upstate NY and I also have a 16 year old brother who just started his junior year in highschool.  </p>
